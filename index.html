            <h3>Where do cats come from?</h3>
            <p>
                <div class="cat-info">From ancient Egyptians to today‚Äôs internet users, people have always loved their cats.

                    In the U.S. alone, cats reign over about 45.3 million households. There are at least 45 domestic breeds, which differ widely in features such as coat color, tail length, hair texture, and temperament, according to the Cat Fancier‚Äôs Association.
                    
                    The Maine Coon is the largest, with males reaching an average of 3.5 feet long. The smallest breed is the Singapura, native to Singapore, with adult females weighing as little as four pounds. One of the most unusual-looking cats is the Sphynx, a mostly hairless cat known for being robust and intelligent.</div>

            <ul>
                <li>Cuddles!</li>
                <li>Boop the nose</li>
                <li>Encourage play with fun cat toys</li>
                <li>Look out of your windows at all the pretty birds</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Speaking Feline</h3>
            <p>Cats are masters at communicating with other cats and their human caregivers. For instance, a quickly swishing tail signals aggression, while a tucked tail means they‚Äôre nervous.

                When relaxed, a cat will move its ears forward and point its tail up in the air or perpendicular to the ground. (Related: ‚ÄúWhat is your cat trying to tell you? Vets weigh in.‚Äù)
                
                When cats rub their faces on the furniture, other cats, or a person, it may be a behavior called bunting. Cats have scent glands in their face, and bunting allows them to mark their territory, bond with other cats, or show affection.
                
                Speaking of, if you want to make your cat feel comfortable, look them in the eye and blink your eyes very slowly. They recognize this as a sign of friendliness, and you may notice them returning the slow blink‚Äîa sign of contentedness.
                
                And it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to call them Your Majesty.

            <h3>How to worship your cat</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Seek an audience with your feline overlord (their schedule is busy).</li>
                <li>Promptly bow to them to ensure they know you are devoted to them</li>
                <li>Bring them an offering - this can be in the form of dreamies or perhaps a new toy</li>
                <li>Give them fusses of their choosing. Some cats like belly rubs, some prefer tickles of the chin.</li>
            </ol>
